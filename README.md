# jsRealB - A JavaScript Bilingual Text Realizer for Web Development

*Version 4.2 - August 2022*

**Natural Language Generation (NLG)** is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of systems that produce text for different applications, for example the textual description of massive datasets or the automation of routine text creation.

The web is constantly growing and its content, getting progressively more dynamic, is well-suited to automation by a realizer. However existing realizers are not designed with the web in mind and their operation requires much knowledge, complicating their use.

**jsRealB is a text realizer designed specifically for the web**, easy to learn and to use. This realizer allows its user to build a variety of French and English expressions and sentences, to add HTML tags to them and to easily integrate them into web pages.

**jsRealB can also be used in Javascript application** by means of a `node.js` module available also as `npm` package. It also accepts an input specification in JSON. 

The documentation can be accessed [here](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/documentation/user.html). You can switch language in the upper right corner of the page. The specification of the JSON input format is described [here](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/data/jsRealB-jsonInput.html).

**Caution**

* `jsRealB` can be used (out of the GitHub!) in a web page using only `jsRealB.min.js` (or `jsRealB.js`) in the [`dist`](dist/) directory.
* [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) is necessary for the Javascript applications and for minifying the Javascript using [`terser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terser "Downloads").
* The current build process relies on the availability of some Unix tools such as `makefile`, `cat` and output redirection (`>`).
* Windows users (and others) will therefore want to use the pre-built files in the [`dist`](dist/) directory.

    * For use in a web page : `<script src="..."></script>`
        * `jsRealB.js`: packages all .js files of the `build` directory as a module and exports only the main functions
        * `jsRealB.min.js`: minified version of the above
    * For use as a node.js module :
        * `jsRealB-node.js`: packages all .js files of the `build` directory as a module and exports only the main functions

    * `package.json`: necessary for publishing the `jsrealb` *npm* package.  
    When a new version is to be put on `npm`, in principle, it should be enough to issue the two following commands from within the `dist` directory (after a npm login):  
      `npm version {major|minor|patch}`  
      `npm publish`  
    Because of the `.npmignore` hidden file in this directory, only `jsRealB.js` and `jsRealB.min.js` are published.

###  Data to Text applications
* **`jsRealB` for the [E2E Challenge](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/ "E2E NLG Challenge")** : browser for the datasets (training, development and test) used in the *End to End Generation Challenge* (2017-2018). The page also shows the English and French output produced by a "rule-based" generator using `jsRealB` for a selection of feature values. There is also a short description of the implementation of the realizer. [Execute](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/demos/e2eChallenge/index.html)
* **_Personalized_ descriptions of restaurants** : how _**jsRealB**_ can be used for varying the linguistic style of the generated text according to a user profile defined as one of the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) model of personality. [Execute](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/demos/Personage/index.html)
* **Description (in French) of a list of events** and associated informations given as a json file [ÃvÃ©nements](demos/Evenements) [Execute](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/demos/Evenements/index.html)
* **Description of list of steps for the building of a house**, given information about tasks, the duration and the precedence relations between them.

  The system first computes the critical path to find the start and end times of each task. It then creates a graphic for displaying the PERT diagram and an accompanying text to explain the steps to follow. It is possible to interactively change the start date and to explore the graphic with the mouse which also uses jsRealB to generate the text of the tooltips.

    The language of the web page and of the realization can be changed interactively by clicking in the top right of the page. [Metro](Tutorial/metro.html) [*Execute*](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/Tutorial/metro.html)
* **Weather bulletin generation in English and French**. An example of use of the Python API for **jsRealB**. Taking weather information in JSON, it generates bulletin in both English and French. [This tutorial describes the organization of the system](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/demos/Weather/Bulletin-generation.html) which shows how **jsRealB** can be used in a real-life situation in conjunction with Python for data manipulation.

### Test demos
* The demos are usually run using the *compiled* version. But after modification of the source files, the version with the separate loading of the file can be obtained by commenting/uncommenting some `<script>...</script>` lines at the start of the html file. The shell script `testDemos.sh` can be used to do this while keeping the original intact. If the script is called with a name of an HTML file, then that file is uncommented and shown in the browser (using the `open` command on the MacOS). With no argument, then all demos are displayed in different tabs. The script waits for 5 seconds between each try.

### Interactive use with *Observable*
* Two [Observable](https://observablehq.com) notebooks are available for trying `jsRealB` expressions and seeing their realizations.

## Design of the system
The current version (4.0) is a redesign and reimplementation of the previous version while keeping intact the external interface, i.e. same name of functions for building constituents, for option names and for global functions. This means that applications using only the external interface of `jsRealB` can be run unchanged. Version 4.0 added the dependency notation.

[This document](Architecture/README.md) first describes the transformation steps within the realizer using a few examples. It then gives an overview of the implementation explaining the role of the main classes and methods.

## Authors
jsRealB was updated, developed and brought to its current version by [Guy Lapalme](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme) building on the work of:

1. [Francis Gauthier](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~gauthif) as part of his summer internship at RALI in 2016; 
2. [Paul Molins](http://paul-molins.fr/) as part of an internship from INSA Lyon spent at RALI, University of Montreal in 2015;
3. [Nicolas Daoust](mailto:n@daou.st) developed the original concept in the _JSreal_ realizer for French only in 2013.
