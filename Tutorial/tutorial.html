        <h1><span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> Tutorial</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p lang="en"><span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> is a text realizer for French and English written in JavaScript to ease its integration in web applications. It can be used either within a web page such as this one in which examples in <span class="js1">this font</span> following an arrow (&rarr;) are dynamically realized or as a <code>Node.js</code> module. The realizer is self-contained and does not need an external server or another JavaScript framework, once it is loaded with the web page.</p>
        <p>The realizer takes care of many language peculiarities such as conjugation, word order, elision, number and person agreements, all <em>small</em> details but that users appreciate or find very annoying or disturbing when they are not properly dealt with. It is also possible to get many variations (e.g. negative, passive or interrogative) of a single sentence structure.</p>
        <p>In <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span>, JavaScript expressions create data structures corresponding to the constituents of the sentence to be produced. When there is a need to get the string output (i.e. its <code>toString()</code> function is called), the data structure (a tree) traversed to produce the tokens of the sentence, taking care of capitalization, elision and appropriate spacing around punctuation. It is also possible to wrap portions of text within HTML tags.</p> 
            <p>The data structure is built by function calls (JavaScript constructors) whose names were chosen to be similar to the symbols usually used for constituent syntax trees: for example, <code>N</code> to create a noun structure, <code>NP</code> for a Noun Phrase, <code>V</code> for a Verb, <code>D</code> for a Determiner, <code>S</code> for a Sentence and so on. Features added to the structures using the dot notation can modify the values according to what is intended.</p>

       <p> The syntactic representation is patterned after the classical constituent grammar notation. For example,</p>
<code id="ex-1">
        S(NP(D("a"),N("woman").n("p")),
          VP(V("eat").t("ps"))).typ({perf:true})
</code>
<p>is the JSrealB specification for <span class="js" code-id="#ex-1"></span>  Plural is indicated with feature <code>n("p")</code> where <code>n</code> indicates number and <code>p</code> plural. The verb is conjugated to past tense indicated by the feature tense <code>t</code> and value <code>ps</code>; the sentence should also use the perfect form. The agreement between the determiner and the noun within the <code>NP</code> and the verb of the <code>VP</code> is performed automatically.</p>
    <p>This document first gives some general information about the way to create a sentence with <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span>. It then illustrates some of the capabilities of <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> with two examples: a <a href="#sentGen">random sentence generator</a> and a more complete <a href="#webApp">data-to-text web application</a> that finds a metro route and generates a text (either in French or in English) describing the itinerary which is also displayed in the page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This tutorial only gives a few indications on the many capabilities and features of the realizer,  <a href="../documentation/user.html">see this document for a  complete documentation</a>;</li> 
        <li><a href="../demos/Evaluation/index.html">Realize a jsRealB expression</a> is a good way to experiment with <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span>. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sentGen">Creating a simple sentence</h2>
    <p>We start with a very simple sentence combining a <em>Noun Phrase</em> as subject of a <em>Verb Phrase</em> with the following steps:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a first <em>Noun Phrase</em> comprising a <em>determiner</em> and a <em>noun</em>: <code id="np-1">NP(D("the"),N("cat"))</code> &rarr;  <span class="js" code-id="#np-1"></span></li>
        <li>Create a second <em>Noun Phrase</em> with a <em>determiner</em>, an <em>adjective</em> and a <em>noun</em>: <code id="np-2">NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#np-2"></span></li>
        <li>Create a <em>Verb Phrase</em> with the second noun phrase as complement: <code id="vp-1">VP(V("eat"),NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse")))</code> &rarr;  <span class="js" code-id="#vp-1"></span></li>
        <li>Create a <em>Sentence</em> with the first noun phrase as subject but its noun is plural:
<code id="s-1">
S(NP(D("the"),N("cat").n("p")),
  VP(V("eat"),
     NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))</code> 
&rarr;  <span class="js" code-id="#s-1"></span>
       </li>
    </ul>
<h3>Constituents</h3>
<p><span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> expressions are built using <em>Constituents</em> which can be either <em>Terminals</em> or <em>Phrases</em> shown in the following table. Terminals take a single string as parameter and Phrases can take an indefinite number of parameters, either Terminals or Phrases.</p>
<table>
	<tr><th></th>             <th>Terminal</th>              <th>Phrase</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Determiner</td>   <td><code>D("..")</code></td>  <td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Pronoun</td>      <td><code>Pro("..")</code></td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Noun</td>         <td><code>N("..")</code></td>  <td><code>NP(...)</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Adjective</td>    <td><code>A(("..")</code></td> <td><code>AP(...)</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Verb</td>         <td><code>V("..")</code></td>  <td><code>VP(...)</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Adverb</td>       <td><code>Adv("..")</code></td><td><code>AdvP(...)</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Preposition</td>  <td><code>P("..")</code></td>  <td><code>PP(...)</td></code></tr>
	<tr><td>Conjunction</td>  <td><code>C("..")</code></td>  <td><code>CP(...)</td></code></tr>
	<tr><td>Subordination</td><td><code></code></td>         <td><code>SP(...)</td></code></tr>
	<tr><td>Sentence</td>     <td><code></code></td>         <td><code>S(...)</td></code></tr>
	<tr><td>Date</td>         <td><code>DT("..")</code></td> <td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Number</td>       <td><code>NO("..")</code></td> <td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Quoted text</td>  <td><code>Q("..")</code></td>  <td></td></tr>
</table> 

<p>The first parameter in a Phrase is usually its head. For example in a Sentence, the first parameter is taken as the subject. 
    The first parameter of a Verb Phrase is its Verb, followed by a direct object unless it is a Prepositional Phrase. 
    These implicit roles are used for setting up the agreement links between constituents. For example, the number of the 
    subject is used as the number of the verb. If these links are not properly set, it is possible to set features explicitly, but most 
    often the default rules are sufficient.
</p>       

<h3>Variations on a simple sentence</h3>
<p>From a single sentence structure, it is possible to get many variations (in <u>blue</u> in this table) by simply adding features (
    written as methods called using the dotted notation) such as the ones in the following table in which the previous sentence 
    is at the future tense:</p>
<table>
    <tr><td>future </td>
        <td><code id="ex-2">S(NP(D("the"),N("cat")),
    VP(V("eat").t("f"),
        NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))</code></td>
        <td  class="js" code-id="#ex-2"></td>
        <tr>
    <tr><td>passive</td>
        <td><code id="ex-3">S(NP(D("the"),N("cat")),
    VP(V("eat").t("f"),
        NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))
    <u>.typ({"pas":true})</u></code>
        </td>
        <td  class="js" code-id="#ex-3"></td>
        <tr>
    <tr><td>question about the subject</td>
        <td><code id="ex-4">S(NP(D("the"),N("cat")),
    VP(V("eat").t("f"),
        NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))
    <u>.typ({"int":"why"})</u></code>
        </td>
        <td class="js" code-id="#ex-4"></td>
        <tr>
    <tr><td>negative</td>
        <td><code id="ex-5">S(NP(D("the"),N("cat")),
    VP(V("eat").t("f"),
        NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))
    <u>.typ({"neg":true})</u></code>
        </td>
        <td  class="js" code-id="#ex-5"></td>
        <tr>
    <tr><td>combination of the above</td>
        <td><code id="ex-6">S(NP(D("the"),N("cat")),
    VP(V("eat").t("f"),
        NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))))
    <u>.typ({"int":"why","pas":true,"neg":true})</u></code>
        </td>
        <td  class="js" code-id="#ex-6"></td>
        <tr>
</table>

<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>Because language generation is not limited to producing list of words, <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> also 
    provides facilities for adding punctuation, wrapping constituents in symbols and HTML formatting. 
    Ã§Formatting is indicated with features added to constituents. To add a string before a constituent, 
    use <code>.b("..")</code> after building the constituent, for example 
    <code id="ex-8">N("man").b("*")</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#ex-8"></span>, 
    similarly <code>.a("..")</code> to add a string after. If the string is an usual punctuation,
     appropriate spacing before and after the sign is added. Pairs of symbols can be added with <code>.ba("..")</code>, 
     for example <code id="ex-9">N("mouse").ba("[")</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#ex-9"></span>.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to add HTML tag around any constituent with the <code>.tag(<em>name</em>,
    <em>attributes</em>)</code>. The tag name is a string and the optional attributes are given by 
    an object whose keys are the attribute names with the corresponding value. For exemple, 
    <code id="ex-10">N("mouse").tag("i")</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#ex-10"></span> 
    displayed as <span class="jsh" code-id="#ex-10"></span> in an HTML page. To create hyperlinks, 
    we can use the <code>a</code> tag, for example <br/>
    <code id="ex-11">N("mouse").tag("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"})</code> &rarr; <br/>
    <span class="js" code-id="#ex-11"></span> <br/>rendered as <span class="jsh" code-id="#ex-11"></span> in a web page.	
</p>
<h3>Saving and reusing <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> expressions</h3>

<span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> constructions can be saved in variables or data structures like any other JavaScript value. 
So our first sentence (<span class="js" code-id="#ex-7"></span>) could have been coded like this.</p>
<code id="ex-7">
    var cats=NP(D("the"),N("cat").n("p"));
    var mouse=NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"));
    S(cats,VP(V("eat"),mouse));
</code>
<p>This is very useful for structuring a complex text built incrementally. 
    This also makes possible to share repeating parts in a text.</p>
<p>The constructors corresponding to constituents create new objects, but features 
    (i.e. methods called with the dot) modify them <strong>permanently</strong>. 
    So some care must be taken when reusing structures saved in variables.<br/> 
For example, with those declarations:</p>
<code>
    const cat1=NP(D("the"),N("cat"));
    const mouse1=NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"));
</code>
<p><code id="s-2">S(cat1,VP(V("eat"),mouse1.pro()))</code> &rarr;<span class="js" code-id="#s-2"></span><br/> 
in which <code>mouse1</code> replaced by a pronoun.</p> 
<p>If we reuse those variables in another context such as <br/>
	<code id="s-3">S(cat1,VP(V("love"),mouse1))</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#s-3"></span> <br/>
in which <code>mouse1</code> is again pronominalized which is probably not intended. 
</p>
<p>This happened because the features modified the original structure. In this case, the modification 
    was applied directly on the value of the variable, but as some properties (e.g. gender, noun, negation, etc.) 
    are propagated between constituents for achieving the appropriate agreements, modifications to shared variables 
    can be more subtle and hard to identify because modifications can happen from a governing or from a sibling constituent. 
    To get around this problem, we can <em>clone</em> any <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> structure to get a new copy of a value. 
    So going back to our original declarations</p> 
<code>
    const cat2=NP(D("the"),N("cat"));
    const mouse2=NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"));
</code>
<p>
<code id="s-4">S(cat2,VP(V("eat"),mouse2.clone().pro()))</code> &rarr;
<span class="js" code-id="#s-4"></span><br/>	 
 without modifying the original as can be seen with <br/>
<code id="s-5">S(cat2,VP(V("eat"),mouse2))</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#s-5"></span></p>

<p>A very convenient way of define <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> is using an <i>arrow function</i> such as 
<code>const mouse3 = ()=>NP(D("a"),A("grey"),N("mouse"))</code> which can be used by applying the function <code>mouse3</code> as
<code id="s-6">S(cat2,VP(V("eat"),mouse3()))</code> &rarr; <span class="js" code-id="#s-5"></span>

</p>
<h2>Generation of random sentences</h2>
<p>Computer generated texts often suffer from repetitions which can be quite annoying for humans who prefer some variation 
    in the texts they read.  <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> makes it easy to create different phrase and sentence structures 
    by creating different constituent tree expressions from which the program can choose.</p>
<p>In many cases, outside constraints, semantic or pragmatic constraints determine the choice, but in some cases it is appropriate 
    to let a random choice between few possibilities.  
    The <code>oneOf(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub> ...)</code> function lets <span class="jsr">jsRealB</span> choose one of 
    the arguments <code>e<sub>i</sub></code>. As JavaScript evaluates all arguments of a function before the call, we can prefix an 
    argument with <code>()=></code> to <em>transform</em> it into an arrow function which will only be evaluated 
    after the selection by <code>oneOf</code>.
</p>
<p>The following code defines three functions: </p>
<ul>    
    <li><code>np()</code> to create a noun phrase with different animal nouns, either singular or plural;</li>
    <li><code>a()</code> to provide an optional adjective</li>
    <li><code>vp() </code> to create a verb phrase (at present, past or future) possibly with a complement</li>
</ul>
<code>
function np(){
    return NP(D("a"),a(),N(oneOf("cat","mouse","dog","rabbit")).n(oneOf("s","p")));
}
function a(){
    return oneOf(
        ()=>A(oneOf("hungry","grey","nervous")),
        ()=>Q("")
    );
}
function vp(){
    return oneOf(
        ()=>VP(V(oneOf("eat","run","love")).t(oneOf("p","ps","f"))),
        ()=>VP(V(oneOf("eat","love")).t(oneOf("p","ps","f")),
               np())
    );
}
</code>
<p>With these definitions, <code>S(np(),vp())</code> will produce a random sentence (containing a noun phrase followed by verb phrase) at each call.</p>

</p>
<p>This random sentence example is a JavaScript transcription of the Prolog/DCG version described in:
Michel Boyer and Guy Lapalme, <em>Text Generation</em>, Chapter 12 of <em>Logic and Logic Grammar for Language Processing</em>,  pp. 256-257, Ellis Horwood, 1990.</p>

<h2 id="webApp">Generation of subway/metro directions</h2>
<p>We now present a complete web application for finding a path in the MontrÃ©al MÃ©tro (subway) network. We will then explain how to generate the itinerary between two stations clicked by user that is generated to the right of the graphic. The application can be used in either French or English with the text generated in the same language, by clicking on the <code style="color: green">[EN]</code> or <code style="color: green">[FR]</code> in the top right corner. In this tutorial, only the English version is described, as the French version is similarly organized and differs mainly in the choice of words.</p>
    
<div id="application">
    <iframe src="metro.html"></iframe>
</div>
<h2>Generation of the itinerary</h2>
<p>Text generation is <em>classically</em> divided in two main steps: 
<ul>
    <li><em>What to say</em> that, in this case, corresponds to the shortest itinerary between two metro stations determined using a classical operations research algorithm; the shortest path is then split in legs along different metro lines taking account transfers;</li>
    <li><em>How to say it</em> that establishes the overall structure of the text according to the length of the itinerary and the number of stops and transfers. Only then will the text realizer be called to create an appropriate English text.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>The first step in a data-to-text project is to find the appropriate data and to <em>massage</em> it into a usable format. In this case, the data was harvested from a <a href="http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/stm-traces-des-lignes-de-bus-et-de-metro" title="STM â TracÃ©s des lignes de bus et de mÃ©tro - Ensembles de donnÃ©es - Portail donnÃ©es ouvertes">public dataset</a>, although in a proprietary format for which we fortunately found a <a href="https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-json" title="SHP to JSON Converter Online - MyGeodata Cloud">web site</a> that allowed us to transform it to <a href="http://geojson.org" title="GeoJSON">geojson</a>. We then used a <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" title="jq">jq script</a> to extract only the information we needed: metro lines with their stations for which we kept their name and coordinates. The <code>jq</code> output was then feed to a small Python script to get a more useful display. We finally <em>hand sorted</em> the station according to their <em>real</em> ordering on each line. As always, this <em>conceptually simple task</em> took more effort than we had initially expected.</p>

<p>Here is a short excerpt of the <a href="metroLinesSorted.js">data for the 68 stations of the metro</a>. Some transfer stations (e.g. <code>Berri-UQAM</code>) appear in more than one line as indicated in their <code>route</code> field.</p>
<code style="font-size:small"><pre>
var routes = [

    ...
    {"id": "64", "station": "Saint-Michel", "route": "5", "coords": [296993.06301460037, 5046632.485787434]}

</pre></code>

<h4>Path computation</h4>
<p>With this data we build an internal data structure of the underlying network having stations as node and estimated travel time (computed from the distance from the coordinates of the stations) as value on the arcs between two consecutive stations. Transfer stations are <em>duplicated</em> on each line and an internal link with transfer time between each line is added.</p>
<p>In the application, once the user has chosen the two stations between which she wants to travel, the shortest path between them is computed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BellmanâFord_algorithm">Bellman-Ford algorithm</a> which is very simple to implement and efficient enough on such a small network.</p>
<p>The shortest path is a list of nodes that is split into <em>legs</em> between transfer stations. For example, the path to go from <code>HonorÃ©-Beaugrand (id="18")</code> to <code>UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (id="57")</code> will be split in three legs corresponding to travels on a line between transfer:</p>
<code><pre>
[[["18",0],["19",1.41],...,["11-1",15.91]],
 [["11-2",20.91],["10",22.23],...,["5-2",29.14]],
 [["5-5",34.14],["61",35.17],...,["57",40.75]]]
</pre></code>
<p>The trip is thus a list of legs which are themselves lists of pairs also lists, the first element being the node id and the second element being the distance in minutes from the starting node.</p>
<p><a href="computeTrip.js">Path computation code</a></p>

<h4>Text generation</h4>
<p>The generated text is organized as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Title indicating the start and end stations;</li>
    <li>Itinerary depending on two cases:
        <ul>
            <li>No transfer: simple and easy;</li>
            <li>With transfers: each leg is described, the first and last ones being special.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This is implemented in this function, which first creates a title wrapped in an <code>h2</code> tag. That title is added in front of the rest of the text either as a direct trip <code>singleLine</code> or one separated into multiple legs (<code>introduction, body, conclusion</code>).</p>
<code><pre>
function generate(trip){
    var duration=last(last(trip))[1];
    var title=VP(V("go").t("b"),P("from"),Q(network[trip[0][0][0]].stationName),
                 P("to"),Q(network[last(last(trip))[0]].stationName)).cap().tag("h2")+"\n";
    if (trip.length==1){
        return title+singleLine(trip[0],duration);
    } else {
        let text=title;
        text+=introduction(trip[0],duration).tag("p")+" ";
        text+="&lt;p>"+body(trip.slice(1,trip.length-1))+"&lt;/p>";
        text+=conclusion(last(trip)).tag("p");
        return text;
    }
}
</pre></code>
<p>We define a few auxiliary functions to realize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>genLine(...)</code> to realize the "name" of a leg: its color and the direction given as the name of start/end station depending on the direction of the trip as given by the indices of the first and last station of the leg;</li>
        <li><code>nbStations(...)</code> to realize the number of <em>stations</em> or <em>stops</em> (chosen arbitrarily): when there is only station, it is written differently.</li>
        <li><code>destination(...)</code> to realize the station name of the destination</li>
    </ul>.
<code><pre>function genLine(leg){
    var from=network[leg[0][0]];
    var to=network[last(leg)[0]];
    var res=NP(D("the"),A(lineColor[from.route]),N("line"));
    if (from.index&lt;to.index){
        if (to!=from.end)
            // do not add direction when the destination is at the last station which will be realized anyway
            res.add(PP(P("towards"),Q(from.end.stationName)));
    } else {

<h5>A direct trip</h5>
<p>After testing the boundary case that the trip starts and ends at the same station, the realizer creates two subordinate phrases by choosing randomly between a few formulations. These two subordinate phrases are then wrapped into a single sentence.</p>
<code><pre>function singleLine(leg,duration){
    if (duration==0)
        return S(Pro("I").pe(2),V("be"),Adv("already"),PP(P("at"),D("my").pe(2),N("destination"))).a("!");
    var sp1 = oneOf(()=>SP(D("this"),V("be"),CP(C("and"),A("simple"),A("fast")),nbStations(leg),
                           Adv("no"),N("transfer")),
                    ()=>SP(Pro("I").pe(2),
                           VP(V("be"),Adv("only"),nbStations(leg),Adv("away"))),

}
</pre></code>
<h5>Trip with transfers</h5>
<p>The <em>introduction</em> starts with global information: the estimated time to destination and then, with different formulations, invite the user to start the trip with the first leg.</p>
<code><pre>function introduction(leg,duration){
    var sp1 = S(Pro("I").pe(2),VP(V("be"),NP(NO(Math.round(duration)),N("minute"))),
                 PP(P("from"),NP(D("my").pe(2),N("destination")))).a(",");

                       PP(P("for"),nbStations(leg))),
                ()=>SP(V("board").t("ip"),PP(P("on"),genLine(leg)))

             );
    return S(sp1,sp2.add(pp));
}
</pre></code>
<p>The <em>body</em> recursively realizes each leg with different formulations</p>
<code><pre>function body(legs){
    if (legs.length==0)return "";
    // console.log(legs);
    var leg=legs[0]
    var out=oneOf(
        ()=>S(VP(V("take").t("ip"),genLine(leg),PP(P("up"),P("to"),destination(leg)))),

        ()=>S(VP(V("transfer").t("ip"),PP(P("for"),destination(leg),P("on"),genLine(leg)))),
        ()=>S(VP(V("switch")).t("ip"),

    );
    return out+" "+body(legs.slice(1));
}
</pre></code>
<p>The <em>conclusion</em> ends by indicating that the trip is finished.</p>
<code><pre>function conclusion(leg){
    var out=oneOf(
        ()=>S(Adv("finally"),Pro("I").pe(2),V("take").t("f"),genLine(leg),
               V("arrive").t("b"),PP(P("to"),destination(leg))),
